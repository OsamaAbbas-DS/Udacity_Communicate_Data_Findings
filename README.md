# Communicate Data Findings Project for Udacity's Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree

For this project we chose the Ford GoBike bike sharing dataset to do our analysis and reporting.

In the exploration phase we decided on our features of interest that would potentially affect the bike share trip duration and then looked into each feature and visualized its distribution. Next, we looked at the relationship between each feature and the trip duration. Then, we looked at the relationship between three or more of our features and how they would affect the duaration. Finally, we presented the findings in a conclusive report with thorough description of each finding.

The report was presented to friends and family members in order to get the feedback of someone with technical background. The report was viewed as clear and understandable for someone with no technical background, as well as being thorough and interesting.

* some segments of code were inspired by the example snippets of code from the Data Visualization portion of the Udacity nanodegree.
